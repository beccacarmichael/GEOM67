# Program notes included throughout the script in various modules
# Detailed notes are provided in readme file found in the program main folder
# Program notes are provided in each module / function section
# Main Program function begins after functions / modules

#Purpose: This program will calculate the minimum required floor height for apartment hunters to prevent full shade at various times of year
#given provide geospatial data. This program will also calculate statistical information about the amount of sunlight hours the user
#can expect to receive, given the same geospatial information.
